# MinecraftDataPacks

Hey, so I made this repository I couple months ago but never posted anything so I'll datapacks instead cause that makes more sense
========================================================================================================================================
Currently I have 1 datapack: Deathrounds which I plan to do this with:

Allow the user to customize the amount of deaths required before the round ends
A reset score command

Might do more packs in the future, who knows
